Assignment: CST136SRS04

Notes: 
Compiled with Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10.

I needed to add "/std:c++17" to the command line settings in my project properties to get it to build when switching computers; I don't know if doing this commit after adding it will fix it forever, so know that it may be necessary.
